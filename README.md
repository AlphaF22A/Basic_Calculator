# Basic_Calculator
My first C# mini-project

To run this program:

Download the entire repository, and launch command prompt (or Powershell) in the folder. Enter 'dotnet run console' to run the program

Alternatively, after downloading the repository, go to bin/Debug/net5.0, then launch Basic_Calculator.exe
